Anyone who's interested in tech is welcome, whether you're just thinking about getting into tech or have been in it for decades. You can come with a question or a topic to discuss, ask for feedback on your portfolio, or just sit back and listen to others talk about tech. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur once twice-weekly zoom community sessions with devs at all stages of the journey has grown into an online community that mentors, creates educational content, and provides a safe community at no cost. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur purpose is to form community, allow room for growth and mentorship, and to meet with both new people and our regulars in a safe and positive space.
